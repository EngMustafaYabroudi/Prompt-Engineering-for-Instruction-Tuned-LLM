    "When constructing a sophisticated application employing an LLM, a crucial yet challenging aspect revolves around evaluating its performance. How can you ascertain if it meets accuracy standards? \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if you opt to alter your implementation — perhaps by substituting a different LLM or adjusting the strategy for utilizing a vector database or other retrieval mechanisms — how can you gauge whether these changes enhance or detract from the application?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook discusses the challenges of evaluating the performance of applications built with large language models (LLMs) and explores strategies for effectively assessing their accuracy and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "It emphasizes the importance of understanding the inputs and outputs of each step in the application’s workflow and introduces frameworks and tools designed to aid in evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it explores the concept of using language models and chains themselves to evaluate other models and applications. With the rise of prompt-based development and the growing reliance on LLMs, the process of evaluating application workflows is undergoing reevaluation.\n",

       "Document(page_content='PAGE 11\\nThe Best Way to Build \\na New Habit\\nOne of my favorite books is BJ Fogg’s, Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change \\nEverything. Fogg explains that the best way to build a new habit is to start small \\nand succeed, rather than start  too big and fail. For example, rather than trying to \\nexercise for 30 minutes a day, he recommends aspiring to do just one push-up, and \\ndoing it consistently.\\nThis approach may be helpful to those of you who want to spend more time studying. \\nIf you start by holding yourself accountable for watching, say, 10 seconds of an \\neducational video every day — and you do so consistently — the habit of studying daily \\nwill grow naturally. Even if you learn nothing in that 10 seconds, you’re establishing the \\nhabit of studying a little every day. On some days, maybe you’ll end up studying for an \\nhour or longer.', metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/how-to-build-a-career-in-ai-pdf/eBook-How-to-Build-a-Career-in-AI.pdf', 'page': 10})"

       "Document(page_content='PAGE 9In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning \\nfoundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported \\nby being part of a community. In this chapter, I’d like to dive more deeply into the first step: \\nlearning foundational skills.\\nMore research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when \\nlearning, it’s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical \\ncareer in machine learning are:\\nFoundational machine learning skills: For example, it’s important to understand models such \\nas linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly \\ndetection. Beyond specific models, it’s even more important to understand the core concepts \\nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \\noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it’s hard to excel \\nin the field without some understanding of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \\npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \\nsequence models, and transformers.\\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \\nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \\nto implement complex AI systems. These skills include programming fundamentals, data \\nstructures (especially those that relate to machine learning, such as data frames), algorithms \\n(including those related to databases and data manipulation), software design, familiarity with \\nPython, and familiarity with key libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.Math relevant to machine learning:  Key areas include linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various \\nmanipulations of them) as well as probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous \\nprobability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes’ rule, \\nand hypothesis testing). In addition, exploratory data analysis (EDA) — using visualizations and other \\nmethods to systematically explore a dataset — is an underrated skill. I’ve found EDA particularly \\nuseful in data-centric AI development, where analyzing errors and gaining insights can really help \\ndrive progress! Finally, a basic intuitive understanding of calculus will also help. The math needed \\nto do machine learning well has been changing. For instance, although some tasks require calculus, \\nimproved automatic differentiation software makes it possible to invent and implement new neural \\nnetwork architectures without doing any calculus. This was almost impossible a decade ago.Learning Technical Skills For a Promising AI Career CHAPTER 2', metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/how-to-build-a-career-in-ai-pdf/eBook-How-to-Build-a-Career-in-AI.pdf', 'page': 8})"
