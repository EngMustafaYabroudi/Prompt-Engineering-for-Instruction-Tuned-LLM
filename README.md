# Prompt-Engineering-for-Instruction-Tuned-LLM
ðŸ§  Prompt Engineering Projects for Instruction-Tuned LLMs
This repository provides a comprehensive set of hands-on projects and guides that demonstrate Prompt Engineering Best Practices for Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). These projects are designed for researchers, developers, and AI practitioners who want to understand and apply prompt engineering techniques to build robust, intelligent NLP systems.

Each module focuses on a specific application or strategy, using real-world scenarios to illustrate how carefully crafted prompts can improve model performance, reasoning, and reliability.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Prompt Engineering Best Practices for Instruction-Tuned LLMs
This module provides an introduction to prompt engineering principles, focusing on models trained with instructions (e.g., T5, FLAN-T5, GPT-4, Mistral-Instruct). It covers techniques such as prompt clarity, task specificity, and the importance of format and tone.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Prompt Engineering for Instruction-Tuned LLMs: Iterative Prompt Development
Explore the process of iteratively refining prompts. Learn how to:

Start with a basic prompt.

Analyze model output.

Adjust based on performance.

Achieve optimal responses through guided experimentation.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Prompt Engineering: Text Summarization
Learn how to create effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate concise, accurate summaries from long text inputs. Includes:

Extractive vs. abstractive summarization.

Controlling summary length.

Highlighting key concepts.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Prompt Engineering: Textual Inference & Sentiment Analysis
Apply prompt techniques to logical inference tasks (entailment, contradiction, neutrality) and sentiment classification. You'll see how the model can:

Determine relationships between sentence pairs.

Detect emotional tone in various contexts.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Prompt Engineering: Text Transforming & Translation
This module demonstrates transforming text from one form to another (e.g., active to passive voice, bullet points to paragraphs) and performing zero-shot translation across languages using multilingual models like NLLB and mBART.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Text Expansion & Generation with Prompt Engineering
Focuses on generating longer text from minimal input using structured prompting. Examples include:

Expanding headlines into articles.

Auto-completing paragraphs.

Creative writing with constrained inputs.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Prompt Engineering: Chain of Thought Reasoning
Learn how to guide models to "think step by step" to improve performance on complex tasks like:

Math problem solving.

Logical reasoning.

Multi-hop question answering.

ðŸ”¹ 8. End-to-End Customer Service System
Build a multi-turn prompt-based conversational system capable of:

Understanding and routing customer queries.

Providing contextual responses.

Escalating to human support when necessary.
Demonstrates the power of LLMs in real-world applications with task-oriented prompting.

ðŸ”¹ 9. Testing Prompt Engineering-Based LLM Applications
Provides tools and strategies to test, evaluate, and benchmark prompt-based systems. Includes:

Defining success metrics (e.g., accuracy, helpfulness).

Running controlled prompt experiments.

Performing regression tests for prompt stability.

ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
Hugging Face Transformers

OpenAI / Azure OpenAI APIs

LangChain (for chaining prompts & workflows)

Python (Jupyter / Streamlit / Gradio for demos)

Evaluation libraries: BLEU, ROUGE, Accuracy, etc.
